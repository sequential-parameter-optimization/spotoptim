    "# Point Selection Implementation\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This feature automatically selects a subset of evaluated points for surrogate model training when the total number of points exceeds a specified threshold.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is implemented as a point selection mechanism for SpotOptim that mirrors the functionality in spotpython's `Spot` class. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementation Details\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "Added to `SpotOptim.__init__`:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `max_surrogate_points` (int, optional): Maximum number of points to use for surrogate fitting\n",
    "- `selection_method` (str, default='distant'): Method for selecting points ('distant' or 'best')\n",
    "\n",
    "### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`_select_distant_points(X, y, k)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Uses K-means clustering to find k clusters\n",
    "   - Selects the point closest to each cluster center\n",
    "   - Ensures space-filling properties for surrogate training\n",
    "   - Mimics `spotpython.utils.aggregate.select_distant_points`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`_select_best_cluster(X, y, k)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Uses K-means clustering to find k clusters\n",
    "   - Computes mean objective value for each cluster\n",
    "   - Selects all points from the cluster with the best (lowest) mean value\n",
    "   - Mimics `spotpython.utils.aggregate.select_best_cluster`\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`_selection_dispatcher(X, y)`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Dispatcher method that routes to the appropriate selection function\n",
    "   - Returns all points if `max_surrogate_points` is None\n",
    "   - Mimics `spotpython.spot.spot.Spot.selection_dispatcher`\n",
    "\n",
    "The method `_fit_surrogate(X, y)` checks if `X.shape[0] > self.max_surrogate_points`. If true, it calls `_selection_dispatcher` to get a subset. Then, it fits the surrogate only on the selected points.  This implementation matches the logic in `spotpython.spot.spot.Spot.fit_surrogate`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Differences from spotpython\n",
    "\n",
    "While the implementation follows spotpython's design, there is a difference: `spotoptim` uses a simplified clustering, it uses sklearn's KMeans directly instead of a custom implementation."
